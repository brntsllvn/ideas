A single pane of glass including all "observability" data across providers could solve a common pain point: most big companies have several providers and aligning all data is a hassle.

Grafana Enterprise is the big competitor. Other single-providers (e.g. DataDog) might eventually allow importing of competitor data. No sign of this yet.

Side note: Grafana API is a pain to work with.
