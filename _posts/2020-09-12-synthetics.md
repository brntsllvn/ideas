Use EC2 to beat AWS Synthetics while providing dashboarding similar to DataDog. Compete on price and configuration options.

Downside: dozens of competitors, large and small. Implies demand, but possibly no room for another product.

Upside: close integration/alignment with RUM could be value-added. Simple CICD solution another pain point to solve. Could also make everything no-code, which is popular nowadays.
